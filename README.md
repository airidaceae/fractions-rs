# Fractions in rust!?!?!?
this is half a proof of concept, half a joke, and 100% important to me.

Ive been thinking about a concept like this for a while and i made a fedi post saying that if i ever made a programming language i would implement this concept. I said it as a joke but i am now tired and not feeling to great about myself so i am going to implement this potentially stupid idea and see how i feel about it. almost no code is working rn, its basically just tests, ill go through and add to this slowly as time goes on

p.s. i hate DECIMALS and i hate FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
